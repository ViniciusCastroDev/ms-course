## Microservices Monorepo

Mono repo containing seven projects structured as microservices, built with Spring Cloud and a set of tools that provide resilience, scalability, and secure communication across services:

- Feign → Declarative HTTP client for communication between services
- Ribbon → Client-side load balancer to distribute requests
- Eureka Server → Service discovery and registration
- Zuul API Gateway → Routes requests and handles authorizations
- Hystrix → Circuit breaker to provide latency tolerance and avoid cascading failures
- OAuth2 + JWT → Authentication and authorization across microservices
- Docker → Containerization of services for local and cloud deployment

## Conceptual Model

This UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram includes a few core entities and a Many-to-Many relationship between Users and Roles. It provides the foundation for demonstrating the implementation of Spring Cloud solutions and the design of a microservices architecture.
